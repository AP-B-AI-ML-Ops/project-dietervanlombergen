# Final Project

## Renewable Energy Forecasting

### Deadline

The deadline for this project is **May 26th 2026** (28/05/2026).

The deadline for the peer evaluation is **June 2nd 2026** (02/06/2026).

### Learning Goals

With this project, you will:

* Deploy an ML-model.
* Set up virtualisation by containerizing an AI-application.
* Use a versioning system for data, models and code.
* Apply orchestration for model development.
* Make sure your ML experiments are reproducible, organised and optimized.
* Apply DevOps principles in an AI-context.

At the end of this project you will have an automated workflow, where a model is generated and deployed as both a **Web Service** (on-demand forecast API) and a **Batch Service** (scheduled inference and monitoring pipeline).

### Context

The renewable energy transition creates grid instability: solar and wind production are weather-dependent and inherently difficult to predict. Grid operators, energy traders, and prosumers all need reliable short-term forecasts to make balancing decisions.

In this project you will build an end-to-end ML system that predicts **solar and/or wind energy production (in MW) for the Antwerp region over the next 24 hours**, using weather forecast data as input.

You will use the data from your **Data Engineering** course. It combines multiple sources:

| Sheet          | Sources                                             | Features                              |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **wind**       | Open Meteo ECMWF, Geo.be, Kaggle (Uccle, Antwerpen) | Wind speed (km/h) per hour            |
| **zon**        | Open Meteo ECMWF, Geo.be, Kaggle (Uccle)            | Solar radiation (W/m²) per hour       |
| **productie**  | Energie Vlaanderen, Elia                            | Solar & wind production (MW) per hour |
| **consumptie** | Energie Vlaanderen, Elia, Kaggle                    | Grid load & consumption (MW) per hour |

The ECMWF model also provides **multi-day ahead forecasts** (hourly), meaning your deployed API can make real predictions using live forecast data — not just backtests.

### Assignment: Renewable Energy Production Forecasting

For the project, you will build an end-to-end ML project. You will need to:

* [ ] Use the dataset provided by the Data Engineering course (see [Dataset](#dataset))
  * *Join the weather sheets (`wind`, `zon`) with the production targets (`productie`) on the `tijd` column. You may choose to predict solar production, wind production, or both.*
* [ ] Describe the problem and your application in the `README.md` of your repository
  * *Explain what is predicted, what the inputs and outputs of your model are, and why this is useful*
* [ ] Train a model on that dataset tracking your experiments
* [ ] Create a model training pipeline
* [ ] Deploy the model as a **web service**
  * *A REST API that accepts weather forecast data as input and returns predicted energy production (MW) for the next 24 hours*
* [ ] Deploy the model as a **batch service**
  * *A scheduled Prefect pipeline that periodically fetches fresh ECMWF weather forecasts, runs inference, stores predictions, and compares them against newly available Elia actuals*
* [ ] Monitor the performance of your model
  * *Use the batch service output to compute error metrics over time (e.g. RMSE), visualise them in Grafana, and trigger a retraining flow when a threshold is exceeded*
* [ ] Follow the best practices

### Technologies
